-> [DNS-Blocklist](DNS-Blocklist) 
<pre> A couple of DNS-Blocklists for my pi-hole Project. 
      short info: I created these by collecting domains from other famous blocklists on the Internet. 
                  I edited them, joined them together, extended them and cleaned up the resulting mess. 
                  If someone is finding that a list has a big chunk of information that is covered by 
                  one of his own lists and can prove to me that he is in fact the owner of that list, 
                  then I am more than happy to mention your contribution to my collective list in 
                  anyway you would like me too. Please understand that I created these Blocklists 
                  simply for the purpose of private use at my own pi-hole. I never did any announcement 
                  on any platform that these blocklists exist. If you are a random user that somehow 
                  found this page I would like to ask you to not use this repositories content as 
                  I am not sure of the legal situation of this DNS-Blocklist collection. Also I can 
                  not gurantee for any maintaince on these list and would strongly recommend to never 
                  access any of the listed domains. If you decide to do so, you do that on your own 
                  risk and I am not responsible for any damage to your system, your wellbeing, etc.
                  Since I never even visited all those sites by myself, I can not even tell you 
                  what these listed domains are about. </pre>
